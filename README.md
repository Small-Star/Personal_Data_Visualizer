# Personal_Data_Visualizer
Collection, analysis, and visualization of personal data

PDV uses Matplotlib to analyze and display various aspects of life that have been quantified, including food and exercise related data, recorded mood, goal completion, and books read. A GUI is provided using wxpython.

Note: PDV was built around the particular way I record my data. Without having data in that same format, the code is not directly useable. To make use of the analysis and display portion of the code, all of the read_data functions would need to be rewritten.
