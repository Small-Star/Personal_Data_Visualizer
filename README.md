# Personal_Data_Visualizer
Collection, analysis, and visualization of personal data

Note: PDV was built around the particular way I record my data. Without having data in that same format, the code is not directly useable. To make use of the analysis and display portion of the code, all of the read_data functions would need to be rewritten.
